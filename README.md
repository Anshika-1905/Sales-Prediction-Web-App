# Sales-prediction-Project

Sales Prediction Web App is a machine learning-based sales prediction web app created during an internship. It allows users to input data to predict future sales. Built with Python and Streamlit.

## About

This repository hosts a machine learning-driven sales prediction web application. The application, built with Streamlit and Python, allows users to input various parameters related to sales data, such as product information, country, shipping details, and discounts. It leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to predict future sales based on the provided inputs. This project serves as a practical example of deploying a machine learning model within a user-friendly web interface.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
